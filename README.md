# FitNets- Course Project for Computational Image Understanding Course
Used concepts of knowledge distillation and hint based training to train a thin but deep student network assisted by a pre-
trained wide but shallow teacher network.
Built a Convolutional Neural Network using Python
Achieved 0.28% improvement over the original work of Romero, Adriana, et al. in "Fitnets: Hints for thin deep nets."
